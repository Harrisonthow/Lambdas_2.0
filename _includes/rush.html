        <button class="accordion">What is rush?<i class="fas fa-chevron-down arrow"></i></button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Rush, also known as recruitment, is a structured two-week period at the beginning of fall and winter quarter when anyone interested in Lambda Phi Epsilon or Greek life in general can come to our events to meet brothers and learn more about the fraternity. Contrary to popular belief, coming out to rush does not commit you to anything at all. You do not have to attend all events to be able to join the fraternity. The only thing we expect from our rushees (prospective members) is that they have a good time at our events. Along the way, we hope that rushees will also meet the brothers and learn more about the values of the fraternity.</p>
            </div>
        <button class="accordion">What is a bid?<i class="fas fa-chevron-down arrow"></i></button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>A bid is an invitation to enter the new member education process and continue on the path of becoming a brother. Bids are given at the end of rush to rushees who the brothers feel would be a good fit to our fraternity. You are not obligated to accept a bid if given one; rush is completely non-committal.</p>
            </div>

        <button class="accordion">Am I required to join if I attend rush events?<i class="fas fa-chevron-down arrow"></i></button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>No. Rush is simply an opportunity for you to introduce yourself and meet the brothers. So have fun, enjoy yourself, and allow us to show you what our brotherhood can offer you.</p>
            </div>

        <button class="accordion">Do I have to pay to check out rush events?<i class="fas fa-chevron-down arrow"></i></button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>No, all rush events are free. All costs are funded by Lambda Phi Epsilon. Rides to all events will be provided as well, if the need arises.</p>
            </div>

        <button class="accordion">What type of person are you looking for?<i class="fas fa-chevron-down arrow"></i></button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>The diversity of our fraternity is due to the individual personalities that make up the house. However, our motto, ‚ÄúLeaders Among Men,‚Äù applies to each and every brother. We are looking for the leaders among the crowd, who will ultimately become the faces of our fraternity.</p>

        <div class="accordion-group">
        <button class="accordion">What is the New Member Education Process?<i class="fas fa-chevron-down arrow"></i></button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>If, at the end of rush, you accept the opportunity to complete the New Member Education Process of Lambda Phi Epsilon, the possibilities are endless. Stressing skills such as leadership, communication, organization, and punctuality, the fraternity's education process will help you develop close bonds of brotherhood with men from all walks of life. These abilities have proven highly useful to brothers well outside the bounds of the fraternity. With an alumni network stretching from Tokyo to London, and with chapters at over 70 universities, you will meet brothers with whom you have an instant bond because of the ideals and experiences instilled during pledging. Simply put, Lambdas is an experience that can greatly enrich your time at THE Ohio State University. Don't be fooled by the stereotypes.</p>

        <button class="accordion">Why LPhiE?<i class="fas fa-chevron-down arrow"></i></button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Why Lambdas? Lambda Phi Epsilon is an organization that will challenge every aspect of your college life‚Äîand for the better. You will learn how to become a leader in your school, in your community, and in the world you enter after college. Lambda life extends far beyond the reach of your school. Today, with thousands of brothers from coast to coast and throughout the world, Lambda Phi Epsilon has become a major institution and a powerful force in the Asian-American scene in the United States. Moreover, your social network on will also expand exponentially as you get to interact with countless men and women affiliated with other Greek organizations, and Lambda alumni who have become very distinguished in their industry. Being a Lambda also carries with it a strong sense of pride and a reputation of being a well-rounded individual. The road to becoming a Lambda is not easy, but the rewards (personal growth, leadership development, etc.) are well worth it. It takes a certain type of man to become a Lambda, someone who wants to become a leader among men.</p>

        <button class="accordion">Do I have to be Asian to join?<i class="fas fa-chevron-down arrow"></i></button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>While we are an Asian American interest fraternity, there are brothers all over the country with ethnicities other than Asian. You do not have to be Asian to come to rush events and you do not have to be Asian to join Lambda Phi Epsilon.</p>
            </div>        

        <button class="accordion">How can LPhiE impact my future?<i class="fas fa-chevron-down arrow"></i></button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Lambda Phi Epsilon has an incredibly strong alumni network, both locally and on the national and international levels. The International Board of Lambda Phi Epsilon has access to many career and networking resources that provide Lambdas with competitive job placements immediately after graduation. Moreover, our annual conventions provide professional development opportunities for the Active Division. Such exclusive resources provide future generations of Lambdas to become successful in any career industry imaginable.</p>
